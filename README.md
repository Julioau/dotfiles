# My everchanging configurations
* First things first, [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) is the best tiling window manager i've ever used. The animations make me so happy.
* [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) is okay, but I am thinking about switching to [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) for unlimited customization ðŸ˜ˆ
* At first I didn't like [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), but i've grown fond of it the more I used it.
* I have been really enjoying the [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/) colorscheme.
* As well as the [Bibata_Cursor](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor), though I might mix and match with [Posy's](http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/) eventually.
This repo also includes some extra tidbits, but it's mainly for my initial configuration of these apps.

In case you don't know what any of the links I posted are:
|Project Name|Description|
|-|:-|
|Hyprland|basically the interface between your programs, your screen and yourself|
|waybar|the 'panel', the 'bar', it is a sacrilege to compare it to the windows task bar, but that's about it|
|AGS|a widget system shell, basically a framework for making your own UI|
|kitty|terminal application|
|catppuccin|as i've said above, it's a colorscheme, for the terminal, for text editors, for _everything_|
|Bibata|cursor|
|Posy's|cursor|

_woo i'm done_
