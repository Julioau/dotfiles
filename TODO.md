* Check if Bread's preferred music player is good
* Finally learn some quickshell ✅ (in progress)
* Fix Nerdfonts ✅
* Keybinds should be bound to each monitor
* Have a way to swap between monitors ✅
* Make my own hypr plugin (probably a fork of hyprsplit, or a bash script)
* Integrate Hyprfreeze, cuz CPU resources are limited ✅
* Change screenshot-related keybinds to take the screenshot first, then select area. <- I'm looking into hyprquickshot, which is a qml based screenshot tool.
